      <p>In the future, I aspire to become a professional software developer, building solutions that help people and make a difference in the world.</p>
      <p>I also hope to combine my coding knowledge with my passion for music, possibly creating apps that assist musicians or music learners.</p>
      <p>Eventually, I want to mentor others and contribute to the tech community in Kenya and beyond.</p>
